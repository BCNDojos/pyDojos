The Programme duration is 3 years, with an estimated budget of 6,000,000 USD. \r\rThe specific Programme objectives are to contribute to:\r-increasing the capacity of the education system and local communities to improve youth employability; \r-enhancing capacities of the Public Employment Services and civil society to develop and deliver an integrated package of youth employability measures; \r-maximizing positive impact of youth migration whilst minimizing impact of irregular migration. \r \rWhy the Programme was created: The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not fully adjusted to meet market needs. When they leave school, youth find that they are not able to find jobs, leading to discouragement, apathy and social exclusion. The Youth Employability and Retention Programme aims to respond to high youth unemployment and prevent the drain of valuable resources from the country. \r\r\rThe Programme was launched in December 2009.\"", "UNDP"], ["\"A pilot initiative supported by the Government of Bihar and UNDP and implemented by the Owner Driven Reconstruction Collaborative has helped rebuild climate resilient houses devastated by the Kosi floods of 2008 through empowering local communities to own the reconstruction process. Recognizing the success of this model the Government of Bihar has up-scaled this pilot to build 100,000 houses in the worst flood affected districts of Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul under its new Kosi Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Scheme.\r\rSometimes in my sleep I can still hear the sound of the river gushing towards my village, says Sangeeta Devi, recalling the terror of a night -- three years ago -- when her village in Supaul district of the eastern Indian state of Bihar was devastated by the mighty Kosi river that left 150,000 people homeless. \r\rSangeeta was among the three million people affected when Kosi, one of the youngest rivers in the world, breached its embankment and within hours inundated vast tracks of land in the northern regions of Bihar, Indias poorest state.\r\rToday she is the proud owner of a disaster-resistant house built the way she wanted under a pilot initiative supported by the Government of Bihar and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and implemented by the Owner Driven Reconstruction Collaborative (ODRC).\r\rUnder the pilot, affected households in two villages received INR 55,000 or just under USD 1,200 each to rebuild their homes. The money was transferred to a joint account on the condition that one account holder was a woman. For many this was a first -- two-thirds of the population in India has no bank accounts. \r\rPeople without land were given additional money to buy land and by putting in some of their own money and labour, home-owners were able to get more out of the scheme. \r\rToday, Sangeetas pride is palpable. The house also has a toilet and solar lights not common in these parts. An additional INR 8,000 (just under $200) was given for constructing an Ecosans toilet, a toilet built above ground-level to guard against groundwater contamination, particularly critical in north Bihar that has a high water table. I no longer dread the long walk in search of privacy every morning she says. \r\rBy empowering families to own the reconstruction process, the pilot also resulted in significant savings. For example, when Jurilal Mandal and his relatives from Puraini village decided to share walls between three houses they saved 30 percent in costs and double the built-up area. \r\rPast experience shows that reconstruction is most successful and houses are less likely to be abandoned when communities themselves are empowered to participate in the process. The Kosi model builds on this approach. In addition to being community-led the use of indigenous building materials and traditional designs is another innovation. All the new homes in Orlaha are made of bamboo that is specially treated to last longer. In addition, local masons have been trained in disaster-proofing techniques, to boost livelihoods and revive village economies. This flexible combination of innovation in design, local skills and participation, resulted in the reconstruction of houses, each with its unique stamp and character. \r\rRecognizing the success of this model the Government of Bihar has up-scaled this pilot to build 100,000 houses in the worst flood affected districts of Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul under its new Kosi Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Scheme. ODRC is supporting the reconstruction process and has set up facilitation hubs to monitor the scheme. Known as Kosi Setu Kendras (KSK) these centres provide day-to-day support to house-owners, generate awareness, monitor implementation and support the district administration. They provide a critical bridge between the community and district administration. Since the announcement of the government plan, The World Bank has committed US$ 220 million to the reconstruction process including the scale up of owner driven housing. \r\rThe ODRC has developed guidelines to ensure the use of low-cost, indigenous disaster-resistant material and 262 masons and bamboo workers have been trained in these new techniques. \r\rIn a multi-hazard prone country like India, frequent disasters pose a challenge to any progress in human development, says Caitlin Wiesen, Country Director, UNDP India, adding, The project demonstrates that lasting solutions are possible when enabling technologies and support, are combined with empowered local communities who own the process. \r\rThe successful up-scaling of the strategy that empowers communities, particularly the poor and marginalised, to prepare for and combat natural disasters has important lessons for India where natural disasters affect millions of people each year.\r\"", "UNDP"], ["\"More than seven million people rely on agriculture and animal husbandry in the Marwar region of the Western Indian state of Rajasthan, one of the worlds most densely populated deserts. Water is a scarce resource for the villages in the region, many of which do not have even a single source of safe drinking water within a 1.6 km radius of their homes. On average this region witnesses six drought years in a decade. It is no wonder that Marwar is known as the land of extremes - with low annual rainfall, non perennial rivers i.e. that flow only during certain times of the year, saline groundwater and extreme temperatures.\r \rIn 2005, the United Nations Development Programme entered into a five-year partnership with the Italian Development Cooperation to reduce the extreme vulnerabilities of communities in this water-scarce region by empowering them to take the lead and indeed overcome a long struggle to access drinking water. \r \rImplemented by the Jal Bhagirathi Foundation, the project reached out to water-scarce communities in 200 villages across Pali, Barmer and Jodhpur districts of Rajasthan. In doing so it addressed the water-related vulnerabilities of close to 300,000 people. Water harvesting structures succeeded in creating additional water storage capacity of 2 million cubic metres in one of the most parched regions of India. \r \rProject interventions have also had a significant impact on reducing household vulnerability. Overall availability and access to water has resulted in a 140 percent decline in expenditure costs per household. Work was undertaken to improve availability of drinking water through building water harvesting infrastructure, adapting technologies to meet unique needs of the region and its communities, encouraging sanitation and hygiene practices, generating livelihoods and establishing a water resource centre that serves as a repository of traditional knowledge on water conservation techniques and the environment. \r \rThe approach has been people oriented that is, the community itself developed solutions to water scarcity and assumed the lead in constructing and conserving water structures and sources. Communities were organised into groups to restore/ build and manage water harvesting systems which resulted in restoring and building close to 300 water harvesting structures. The community approach also paved the way for decentralized social governance systems and community level social capital was created through managing and implementing micro projects by the communities themselves. Through the Jal Kosh or water development and management fund, communities maintained bank accounts to undertake sustenance and maintenance activities. Further, the facilitation of small water enterprises (SWEs) in villages as community- owned institutions has contributed to increased availability of inexpensive and safe drinking water.\r \rFor women in particular efforts to build equitable access to water resources have paid off. Many were saved from the drudgery of walking long distances for water and families were able to access water during months of acute shortage. The proactive involvement of women in community activities have contributed to greater social inclusion in a predominantly patriarchal society. Further, the supply of water, mainly by women through small water enterprises has provided crucial sources of income and helped families achieve financial security. Importantly, the project has provided critical inputs to several state policies including the Rajasthan State Water Policy. The project has received recognition both at national and international fora including at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \r \rAs India strives to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, partnerships such as this in the Marwar region can provide important inputs for future interventions by demonstrating the effectiveness of grassroots strategies to empower communities to manage water resources. As the threat of climate change looms large , global per capita water availability is expected to decline from 1820 m3/yr in 2001 to 1140 m3/yr in 2050 . The Marwar experience can provide important lessons on combating the impacts of this global challenge. This combination of collective action, traditional knowledge and inclusion can lay the ground for sustainable access to water, and represent a critical poverty reduction strategy for communities across India.\r\"", "UNDP"], ["\"Implementing Partner: Ministry of Local Administration\rPractice Area: Democratic Governance\rTotal expenditures to Date (Dec 2010): US$ 415,677\rStatus: Ongoing\rLocation: Damascus\r\rDescription / Overview: \rUNDP support for disaster management in Syria began in June 2002 in response to the Zeyzoun Dam collapse which claimed 22 lives, destroyed villages, irrigation systems, and agricultural lands and resulted in the loss of livelihoods for more than 400,000 people. During this disaster, the UN system played a central role in assisting national and local authorities in managing and coordinating relief efforts and post-disaster rehabilitation.\r\rDue to challenges observed within the national response mechanism, UNDP developed a Preparatory Assistance activity to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the status of disaster preparedness and to develop an activity to support the priority disaster preparedness gaps identified during this Preparatory Assistance phase. The Project initiated important work in boosting disaster preparedness capacities and focused on disaster management training, preparedness planning and awareness raising at the Governorate level for the Local Disaster Management Committees. The Comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction Programme, also sponsored by UNDP, ran from 2005 till February 2009. In addition to the building of local capacity and expertise, the project contributed significantly to the integration of disaster risk reduction in national development plans; as is evident by the inclusion of a separate chapter on disaster risk reduction in the tenth five-year plan adopted by the Syrian Government in 2005. Additionally, UNDP has supported the implementation of a Sub-regional project, focusing on information exchange, knowledge sharing and regional partnership development for disaster risk reduction. The current project Strengthening Capacity for Disaster Risk Management in Syria aims to strengthen Syrias disaster risk management capacity via the development of the national disaster risk reduction capacity and the reinforcement of the current institutional and legislative framework, while also enhancing local level risk management initiatives and supporting the incorporation of disaster risk reduction in the educational system.\r\r\r \r\rObjectives: \rExecuted in partnership with the Ministry of Local Administration, this project works to incorporate disaster assessment and disaster management components in future sustainable development projects and policies. In particular, this project works to emphasize that Disaster Risk Reduction efforts should include all aspects of planning for, and responding to, disasters. It refers to the management of both the risks and the consequences of disasters and recognised that this involves a wide variety of tasks before, during and after the event itself, including:\r\r(i) Development plans and activities based on preventive and mitigation measures at all levels in disaster-prone areas; \r(ii) Emergency response when a disaster occurs, including search and rescue, relief, initial rehabilitation/repairs; and\r(iii) Post-disaster reconstruction/long-term recovery and rehabilitation.\r\rThe strategic aim of the project is to help ensure that sustainable development efforts in the Syrian Arab Republic will not be significantly hindered or setback by risks arising from any future disasters. The strategy of this project will be achieved by cooperating with the Government of the Arab Syrian Republic and to build upon previous cooperation between the UNDP and the Government in order to help address the above challenges and achieve the above objectives. Specifically, the project will work at strengthening the Disaster Risk Reduction approach and efforts in the Syrian Arab Republic through the following project outputs:\r\r -To strengthen institutional and legislative systems for comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction\r -To improve access to information on disaster risk and disaster risk management, including the incorporation of DRR in the educational sector\r -To develop a disaster risk management master plan for the city of Damascus\r -To develop and improve capacity building for mitigating the impact of future droughts \r -To develop gender sensitive DRR plans and legal & institutional frameworks and to strengthen the capacities of community and stakeholders in gender sensitive DRR\r\rTarget Beneficiaries:\rIn broad terms, the beneficiaries of the Project will be the Government and the People, in particular vulnerable groups, of the Syrian Arab Republic who will enjoy a higher degree of protection against risks arising from natural hazards. As a result of the outcomes of this project, the beneficiaries will have a better use of the resources and will enjoy a cleaner environment. Specific beneficiaries include:\r-The Ministry of Local Administration, the Ministry of Environment, The Ministry of Education, and all the line Ministries and the Directorates General within these Ministries.\r-The Planning and International Cooperation Commission\r-Higher National Committee & committees of local governorates\r-Fire and rescue services, civil defence (including the Central Command) and police departments\r-Seismology Department of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources\r-Ministry of Education and schools\r-Red Crescent (SARC) and NGOs such as the Womens Union of the Syrian Arab Republic\r-The media, and local community groups and organizations.\r\rNecessary care has to be taken to ensure that in all capacity building activities, and all other Disaster Risk Reduction Activities, gender issues be given the due significance it deserves. Mechanisms will be developed to ensure that the participation of women is an integral part of the disaster risk reduction plans. This in turn will ensure that women as a group will not have a higher degree of exposure to risks.\r \r\rImplementation Strategy: \rIn order to achieve the above-mentioned outputs, the program aims to implement the five overall outputs as follows:\r Strengthen institutional framework and strategy for crisis and disaster risk reduction and coordination; strengthen legislative mechanisms at central and local level; support DRR plans of large infrastructure facilities; support DRR plans through strengthening the CDRP and line ministries at local levels; support DRR and management at governorate level; elaboration of earthquake mapping; and enhancing the GIS database in the crisis management center \r Develop and enhance the disaster database while identifying training needs and enhancing the capacities of various audiences; develop media strategy; strengthen Disaster Management System Information Database (with GIS); develop and strengthen local DRR databases; training of relevant DRR national specialists and introduction of DRR in the educational system, including higher education.\r Raise awareness surrounding earthquakes and their risks; review institutional and legislative mechanisms for earthquake risk reduction; review current knowledge and practices; develop risk parameters; strengthen DRR institutions at Damascus level; and develop framework for earthquake risk master plan.\r Submit and coordinate institutional & legal drought risk mechanism with key players; review of institutional and legislative mechanisms for drought risk reduction; support and strengthen framework for drought risk master plan; and strengthen capacities for mitigating impact of future drought\r Gender concerns integrated into institutional frameworks, legislative mechanisms, national and local level DRR plans and earthquake and drought plans; Building of national capacities at central, regional and local level for vulnerable women groups; Develop and implement gender based media strategy; Develop gender based monitoring and evaluation scheme.\rIt is recognized that the activities and outputs listed below require a multi-year, multi-stakeholder programme with substantial funding. The current project aims at setting a clear, sustainable course to contribute towards the achievement of these outputs. \r \r\r\rAchievements / Current Status: \rOverall, the \"\"Strengthening Capacity for Disaster Risk Management in Syria\"\" project has built on the successes of previous interventions, consolidating results, and moving the DRR agenda further as an important component for development in Syria. The UNDP-led progress achieved in 2010 supports the development of a comprehensive and coordinated disaster management system in Syria. Notably, the inclusion of a chapter on Disaster Risk Reduction in Syrias Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the review of institutional and legislative mechanisms of DRR, which has strengthened the ability of mandated institutions to perform their role. Training activities and national awareness campaigns targeted at local administration officials have significantly raised citizens awareness and contributed to increased capacity on disaster risk reduction in Syria. In particular, these are some of the recent achievements of the project:\r Institutional & Legal Framework: \r* A chapter on Disaster Risk Reduction has been adopted in Syrias Eleventh Five-Year Plan which adopts the strategies of the Hyogo Framework Action Plan.\r* Institutional and legislative mechanisms of disaster risk reduction have been reviewed and preliminary required measures, procedures and strategies to achieve a national strategy for DRR were agreed.\r* Required phases defined for the implementation of Damascus Earthquake Master Plan.\r* Draft agreement on the Seismic Assessment of Risk for the city of Damascus prepared with the National Earthquake Center and is being reviewed by the NEC. \r Access to DRM information:\r* Database on previous disasters has been finalized for the last 30 years.\r* Databases on capacities and resources have been finalized.\r*Workshops conducted with local authorities, joint training plan prepared with the Syrian Red Crescent and UNICEF, and a coherent awareness-raising strategy and framework is being carried out. \r*M.Sc. in Disaster Risk Reduction planned in collaboration with Damascus University.\r* Awareness-raising materials produced and disseminated; including games and materials for children\r Develop disaster risk management master plan for the city of Damascus\r* The implementation phases for Damascus Earthquake Master Plan have been defined\r* Seismic Assessment of Risk for the city of Damascus: Draft agreement with the National Earthquake Center has been prepared and is being reviewed by the NEC.\r* Develop retrofitting methods: The Working Group that will be responsible for reviewing the available retrofitting mechanisms and developing new methods for retrofitting has been defined.\r Drought Risk Management \r* Arab Center for the Study of Arid Zones and Dry Lands (ACSAD) has been identified as the most suitable body for implementing the initiative of reducing drought vulnerability in urban areas and an agreement has been signed to implement the initiative.\r* Questionnaires have been prepared for implementing social, field, and agricultural surveys ACSAD has planned the initial surveys.\r Integration of Gender in national and local DRM efforts:\rConsultant recruited for mainstreaming gender into all project components, elaborating a detailed strategy to increasingly involve vulnerable groups in disaster management plan preparation. A needs assessment for DRR training of vulnerable groups will also be conducted as well as a gender-sensitive media strategy will be prepared.\r \rPartnerships: \rThe BCPR-Disaster Reduction Team in close collaboration with the Strategic Planning Unit will provide technical support for the implementation of this project.

Several gaps were identified, which resulted in prioritizing a number of training programmes to support a multi-sectoral response to HIV & AIDS. The programmes are to be supported by various materials: a Behaviour Change Communication Toolkit focusing on HIV & AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, especially to support work with populations that are most at risk; a training manual on HIV & AIDS and the law to train judges, lawyers and paralegal workers; a training manual to support work with the uniformed services; and an HIV & AIDS university curriculum, to be integrated into universities. Each of these toolkits is in the process of being finalized, and the Behaviour Change Communication Toolkit has already been used to train truck drivers, IDPs, groups of women, and people living with HIV.\r\rThe HIV & AIDS and the Law Toolkit will be piloted in 2009 by the Law Faculty at the University of Hargeisa, training judges, prosecutors and paralegal workers in Somaliland. The manual recognizes that a countrys population relies on a strong, knowledgeable and effective judicial community to protect and defend the rights of individuals, in particular people living with HIV. The HIV & AIDS training manual to support work with the uniformed services will be tested through training the Inter-service Council, which has representatives from three Somaliland ministries: the Ministry of Interior (Police), the Ministry of Justice (Custodial Corps) and the Ministry of Defence (Military Personnel).

The Government, through the implementation of the National Recovery Strategy (NRS), and working in collaboration with partner organisations, has facilitated the reintegration of Internally Displaced Person (IDPs). By the end of September 2009, all IDP camps have been closed and IDPs have either returned or relocated to communities. However, sources of conflict remain in communities: social resentment towards returned IDPs, disputes over resources and land and property, large youth population and high unemployment rate, rivalries among martial arts groups, political and regional divisions and local conflicts. These tensions are experienced differently by women and men, and the incorporation of womens perspectives and experiences in addressing these issues is largely absent. In order to address these issues, a trust-building pillar was implemented as an integral part of the NRS.

It tackles constraints to change by identifying and supporting coalitions of interest across civil society, government, the private sector and media. These coalitions are engaging in Projects funded by the Programme to tackle a wide range of fundamental issues including:\r\rcorruption in the Public Sector; \rthe impact of climate change; \rthe need for consultation on constitutional reform; \rincreasing transparency in the application of revenues; \rgender and affirmative action; \rwater management governance; and \rthe promotion of the rights of differently-abled people. \rThe Coalitions for Change Programme (C4C) is a direct response to DFID Nigerias Drivers of Change (DoC) analysis which argued, amongst other things, that individuals and organisations agents acting on their own would be hard-pressed to drive meaningful long-term change. In tackling the fundamental constraints to change in Nigeria DoC suggests an approach that identifies and supports coalitions of interest. Such coalitions should be supported to work on issues that engage their stakeholders and that have the potential to lead to institutional change.\r\rC4C is DFID Nigerias main vehicle for supporting and testing this new and innovative issues-based approach (IBA) to development. It is developing and implementing a series of specific issue-based projects (IBPs). These in turn drive change in the institutions rules and norms as distinct from organisations that sustain two of the principal constraints to Nigerias achievement of the MDGs: the mismanagement of public revenues; and weak formal accountability. \r\rC4C is a national programme supporting campaigns and coalitions addressing national issues. It can also support coalitions that have a specifically regional or multi-state focus. Coalitions for Change builds on previous and continuing DFID-sponsored work in Nigeria and is establishing strong links with these, including: SLGP (State and Local Government Programme), FPSR (Federal Public Sector Reform), STAND (Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in the Niger Delta) and SNAP (Strengthening the National Assembly Project) as well as NEEDS (National Economic Employment and Development Strategy) and SEEDS (State Economic Employment and Development Strategy) initiatives.\r\rThe programme is very much in line with Nigerias poverty reduction strategy (PRS), the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), which argues that changing the way government works is fundamental to pro-poor change. NEEDS recognises that this cannot be achieved through traditional technocratic approaches alone. In talking of social charters and of empowering people NEEDS highlights the requirement for initiatives like C4C that strengthen citizens voice and apply constructive pressure on government. By working with issues-based coalitions C4C is connecting supply-side governance reforms with popular demands for change. This is particularly vital where governments are not used to engaging with civil society organisations.\r\rNigeria is a young democracy and does not yet have a Government NGO cooperation institution. NGOs and CSOs are still viewed with some suspicion by Government. The C4C programme paves the way for increasing cooperation between Government and NGOs/CSOs.\r\rThe individual IBPs are as follows: Anti-Corruption (AC), Affirmation of Rights of Persons with Disability (ARPWD), Climate Change IBP/ Nigeria Climate Action Network (NigeriaCAN), Constitutional Reform Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM), Extractive Industries Revenue Transparency Initiative (EIRTI), Gender and Affirmative Action (GAA), Monitoring the Virtual Poverty Fund (MVPF), Northern Nigeria Water Governance Initiative (NNWGI), Strategic Opportunities Fund (SOF).\r\r\rWebsite: http://www.coalitions4change.org/\r\rHTSPE Services \rWorking with national and international partners, HTSPE provides overall management in this project.

The immediate short-term priorities were to tackle payroll fraud, remove ghost workers and large numbers of redundant posts, facilitate a process of organisational restructuring, improve service delivery standards, and start a process of pay reform that would provide incentives for good quality staff to come into the service and stay there. \r\rCivil service reform is a politically contentious process, particularly in the capital city Abuja where much economic activity revolves around the machinery of the federal government. A key challenge of this assignment is therefore to present reform as being about more than job cuts. The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), which fulfils many of the functions of a State government in Nigerias federal system, is the key service provider for the Abuja area. It has an important role to play in demonstrating that restructuring and the reduction of excess staffing costs can free up resources and reallocate staff to improve service delivery in the Territory. In doing so it can communicate a clear message that reform is about improving the performance of government, not cost-cutting for its own sake. \r\rHTSPE was contracted by DFID to manage its programme of support to pilot ministries and central civil service agencies. HTSPEs support to the reform process took three forms: \r\rSupport to the Federal Government of Nigeria to develop a clear road map for sustainable improvements to the performance of the public sector; \rEnsuring that service delivery pilots effectively demonstrated the benefits of restructuring and reform for service delivery; \rStrengthening central Civil Service Agencies to enable them to make a positive contribution to the reform process. \rThe immediate focus was to review the reforms which had already taken place under the leadership of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory in five pilot ministries, and ascertain what support was required to further the reform process.\r\rResponsibility for the implementation and execution of the reform programme remained firmly within Nigerian institutions. \r\rSupport was provided to the key civil service agencies to enable them to lead the reform process. This included the Bureau for Public Service Reforms (BPSR), the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF), and the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC).\r\rGreat emphasis was on facilitating the process of Nigeria-led reform to ensure the sustainability and appropriateness of the outcomes. Extensive support was given to the process of developing a National Strategy for Reforms, which involved substantial consultation with a range of stakeholders to ensure as large a buy-in as possible.\r\rThe service improvement pilots focussed on the FCTA, as this organisation is the key service delivery agency based within the FCT. FPSR supported two projects to achieve visible improvements in services provided. Each pilot has a logical link to the organisational restructuring of the civil service either because restructuring of staff is integral to the project, or because money saved from eliminating payroll ghosts and redundant posts can be used to improve services in the long run. The pilots emerged from a consultation process that the FCTA carried out in developing a poverty reduction strategy document for the Territory. Priorities included education, water and roads.\r\rHTSPE Services \rOur assistance to the Civil Service of Nigeria included:\r\rReview of the right-sizing efforts within the FCTA \rAssessment of the reforms efforts within the pilot ministries to April 2007 \rScoping, design and implementation of two Service Improvement Pilots (in rural water and adult education), to provide tangible improvement in service delivery, and to highlight the direct link between reforms and this improved service delivery to citizens \rDesign, funding, and monitoring and evaluation of a Challenge Fund, to enable civil service departments to assess their own needs and take the lead on reforming to provide better services \rOrganisational Reviews of BPSR, FCSC and OHCSF \rReview of Pay and Benefits, particularly for Scarce Specialist Skills (SSSs) \rAssistance to the development of a Communications Strategy within BPSR, and the funding of an individual to lead the process within the Bureau to communicate the benefits of reform to the public service and the wider public \rAssistance to the development of a Monitoring and Evaluation framework within BPSR, and the funding of an individual to lead M&E; within the Bureau in the short-term and build the capacity of staff within the M&E; Unit \rContributing to the Public Service Reform strategy for Nigeria \rTraining of 14 high level public servants to enable them to lead the reform process within their own Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) \rIn-country training of over 160 public servants on Change Management, Human Resource Management and Development, M&E;, and Project & Programme Management \rOrganisational Development Plans for key agencies leading the reform process \r \r\"", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["\"Expertise \r2,500 staff months of expertise in programme management; public service reform; public financial management; human resources; local government; capacity building; knowledge management; training; policy and strategy.\r \rProject Background \rThe programme objective is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of state governments use of public resources.

These Reform Plans then drive SPARCs workplans for supporting the State Governments.\r\rWithin each state the key public administration institutions were identified during the Inception Phase of the programme, and a structured approach to capacity building developed and implemented. Capacity building is about more than just training, and SPARC takes this wider view of the reform process.\r\rSPARC is working within a small selection of Nigerias 36 states. Federal Government structures are also being supported, to build their capability to support the reform process within all the states of Nigeria. This key area of support from SPARC ensures that the reach of the programme is far greater than the states it is directly working in. State-to-state learning and knowledge exchange is encouraged, and, through SPARC, assistance given to the Federal Government to take over this role and expand the reach of the reforms.\r\rSPARC works closely with its sister programme, SAVI (State Accountability and Voice Initiative) which focuses on CSO development to identify key areas where government and CSOs can be brought together to improve policy-making, PFM and democratic dialogue with the aim of improved service delivery to citizens.\r\rWebsite: http://www.sparc-nigeria.com/\r\rHTSPE Services \rHTSPE is providing services at State Level in the following areas:\r\rPolicy and Strategy: particularly State Economic Empowerment & Development Strategy (SEEDS). \rPublic Service Reform: development of a reform plan in each of the current five states and support to implementation. Assessment of structure, legal framework, HRM and current reform plans (if any). \rMonitoring and Evaluation: building capacity of government monitoring and evaluation systems. There is currently limited monitoring, evaluation and statistical information to inform policy formulation and the information available is often uncoordinated or poorly presented. \rPublic Financial Management: SPARC focuses on strengthening PFM systems to reduce waste and increase the likelihood of budgets being implemented as planned. This includes working with central ministries to support the introduction of tools, such as the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, which build stronger linkages between sector policies and annual budgets including those for health, education and growth. \rHTSPE is also supporting the Federal Governments in their reform process.\r\rProgramme-wide HTSPE is supporting Knowledge Management at four key levels:\r\rsupport to Knowledge Management initiatives within the workstreams of Lead State work programmes; \renabling wider replication and adoption in non-Lead States and at Federal Level; \racross the suite of new State Level Programmes (covering SPARC, ESSPIN [education sector], PATHS2 [health sector], and SAVI [CSOs]); and \rsupport to the efficient management of SPARC. \r \r\"", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 85 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Nationwide \u00a0 THEME: Livestock/veterinary services", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 15 months \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Alger \u00a0 THEME: Agricultural development", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 100 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Mongolia \u00a0 THEME: Rural development", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 275 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Algerie \u00a0 THEME: Employment policy and administrative management", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 350 days \u00a0 THEME: Food aid/Food security programmes", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 81 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Africa , Asia , Central and Latin America , Middle East \u00a0 THEME: Food aid/Food security programmes", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 183 days", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 120 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Provinces of Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, Bokeo, Sayaboury, Oudomxay and Xiengkhouang, Laos \u00a0 THEME: Administrative costs", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 3 months \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: MINISTERE DE L'AGRICULTURE, ELEVAGE ET PECHE", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 4 months", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 5 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: The services will be performed in the EuropeAid Cooperation Office in Brussels, Belgium. \u00a0 THEME: Human rights", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 133 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Bissau \u00a0 THEME: Agricultural policy and administrative management", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 30 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Pakistan Beneficiaries: Parliament, civil society, general population \u00a0 THEME: Democratic participation and civil society", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 191 days \u00a0 THEME: Human rights", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 15 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Jordan, Amman \u00a0 THEME: Decentralisation and support to subnational government", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 100 days", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 60 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Indonesia (Jakarta, Bali, Makassar, Palembang, Bandung, Surabaya) \u00a0 THEME: Multisector aid", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 7 months \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Brussels \u00a0 THEME: Administrative costs", "HTSPE Ltd."], ["DURATION: 365 days \u00a0 ACTION LOCATION: Malawi - central region (Lilongwe) where the services will be carried out at the NFRA located in the capital.

The programme aims to save lives, reduce suffering, and in permissible contexts, increase resilience. The high risk security situation makes it extremely challenging for DFID to effectively monitor the delivery and impact of programmes in Syria and the region. Many partners also manage downstream partners remotely so it is critical that they have robust monitoring and evaluation systems. As part of a wider business case for technical assistance to the DFID Syria/Iraq humanitarian response, DFID will contract an independent yeah monitoring agent for a duration of up to three years (2015-2018) to assess implementing partners' monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and conduct monitoring visits inside Syria and the region, giving DFID greater assurance of results, reduce corruption risks and improve due diligence, learning and future funding allocations.

Thanks to a joint initiative by the Government of Japan, UNICEF and non-governmental organization Caritas Cyangugu, the quality of life and health of more than 100 households in the village of Gihundwe has rapidly improved through the installation of eco-san latrines. More accessible Marinatha, 13, is grateful for the new latrines, which are more sanitary and convert human waste so that it can be used as fertilizer. She now has one just metres from her mud and wood home. Her old latrine was much further from her house, unhygienic and difficult to keep clean. The difference has been immediate.

Rwanda has made enormous progress towards improving child survival, growth and development in earthquake-affected areas. But these positive trends have been hampered by the destruction of health, education, water and sanitation infrastructure. In January 2009, the Government and Japan and UNICEF signed a $7.5 million agreement to rebuild the earthquake-affected western province of Rwanda. This included installing eco-san latrines. \"", "UNICEF"], ["\"By Isabel Benlloch MALABO, Equatorial Guinea, 18 December 2008 - A new initiative called Sports and Peace was launched in Equatorial Guinea during a special football match at the Stadium of Malabo in September.

UNICEFs Deputy Executive Director Kul Gautam was in Vanuatu early this fall for the launch of a UNICEF-supported programme that has brought a community FM radio network to life. Vanuatu is made up of 83 islands. The vast distances between communities create ongoing challenges in reaching people in remote areas. The purpose of the project was to improve the spread of information, as well as to open new avenues of communication in a largely oral culture. Fifty percent of Vanuatus population of around 202,000 is under the age of 15 years. In early 2004, the Community Radio Society of Tafea (CReST) began the process of setting up a community FM radio network for people who live in the province of Tafea, Vanuatu. UNICEF Pacific sponsored the programme as part of a larger effort to enhance the educational media experience of South Pacific's students, teachers, parents, community leaders, and others. After the Child Friendly Schools (CFS) project of Vanuatu Education and UNICEF supplied the station with two transmitters, the local board of trustees took control of the administration, programming, and direction of the station. UNICEF and its partners hope the radio network will enhance communication and educational opportunities for all children in Vanuatu.\"", "UNICEF"], ["\"HA NOI, Viet Nam, 3 September 2010 According to key findings presented in a UNICEF report entitled An Analysis of the Situation of Children in Viet Nam 2010, Viet Nam has made tremendous progress for its children in a remarkably short period of time, with unprecedented reduction in under-five mortality rates and poverty. Yet there remains an unfinished agenda for children in the country, in particular in terms of hygiene, sanitation, child poverty, nutrition, child protection and education quality and management. Milestone report Segments of the child and adolescent population in Viet Nam continue to live in conditions of deprivation and exclusion, and ethnic minorities are among the poorest communities in the country, benefitting the least from the countrys economic growth. The analysis was carried out by UNICEF between 2008 and 2010, in close collaboration with the government. It represents an important milestone in documenting, analyzing and understanding the situation of children in Viet Nam. The study was informed by a human rights-based approach and is intended to serve as an up-to-date, comprehensive reference for all stakeholders involved in promoting child well being, as well as support the development and implementation of policies and strategies to further realize the rights of Vietnamese children. \"", "UNICEF"], ["\"By Tim Ledwith SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador, 1 December 2009 UNICEF and a national association of municipal governments held a gala event in the capital yesterday, launching a Seal of Approval programme designed to improve the lives and ensure the rights of Salvadoran children and adolescents. More than 100 mayors from towns around the country signed up for the programme on the spot, and more are expected to join. El Salvador has a total of 262 municipalities. Milagro Navas, president of the local governments association (known by its Spanish acronym, COMURES), called the new initiative a great opportunity to change the lives of young Salvadorans at risk. Among them are over 1.3 million children living in poverty and thousands of adolescents who suffer disproportionately each year from gang violence in poor and marginalized communities. In the face of such challenges, asked Ms. Navas, Who could be better than UNICEF to help municipalities protect the rights of boys and girls? Development, policy and participation Over the next two years, local governments seeking the UNICEF Seal of Approval will have to work toward measurable gains for children in three broad areas: human development, public policy and youth participation. The approach is inspired by a similar, UNICEF-supported effort that has proven highly successful in Brazil. To be approved, the municipalities must: ? Show above-average progress in providing access to education and health care for all children, birth registration for infants and antenatal care for pregnant women ? Provide opportunities for children and adolescents, as well as civil-society organizations, to help make decisions that directly affect young lives ? Enact and implement specific local ordinances that bolster child rights, in line with El Salvadors Law on the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents. Passed by the national legislature earlier this year, the new law coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It enters into force in February 2010, establishing new responsibilities and providing greater support for the protection of child rights at the local level. \"", "UNICEF"], ["UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the development of a Case Management Data Base to enable effective assistance and social protection for children in need of special protection measures-particularly children deprived of parental care and those at risk of abandonment.", "UNICEF"], ["\"By Nicole Harvey PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea, 10 November 2009 On a recent afternoon, the head nurses of Port Moresby General Hospitals paediatric wards, Sister Betty Pandum and Sister Veronica Dramoi, welcomed the arrival of 80 colourful, hand-made blankets.

The project is supported by UNICEF and the Government of Japan. The newly opened school, Mohamed Mussa Shafiq High School in eastern Kabul, is situated in a new suburb named after Ahmad Shah Durrani, the first king and founder of modern Afghanistan. This neighbourhoods development on the outskirts of the capital bears witness to the exponential growth of the citys population in recent years. The 1,000 Classrooms Project addresses the severe scarcity of teaching and learning spaces in Kabul. It is especially focused on increasing educational opportunities for girls. Upon completion of the project, students will benefit from access to safe, healthy and hygienic learning environments. In addition, over 3,000 teachers will have been trained in child-centred, participatory teaching techniques. \"", "UNICEF"], ["30,850,000 PACKS OF ALBENDAZOLE 400MG", "UNICEF"], ["SUPPLY OF PHARMACEUTICALS", "UNICEF"], ["ACQUISITION OF MEDECINES AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENTS", "UNICEF"], ["Procurement of HIV, Hepatitis B and C Screening Kits", "UNICEF"], ["Procurement of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)", "UNICEF"], ["PROCUREMENT OF HIV AND HBV SCREENING KITS FOR FY05-06 FROM M/S UNICEF", "UNICEF"], ["Loan No.: 2842-AZE Project Name: Water Supply & Sanitation Investment Program-Tran.

USAID TAWON's agricultural interventions will represent part of a broader portfolio of non-agricultural FTF Tajikistan activities implemented through separate mechanisms to address sanitation, hygiene, health behavior change, iodized salt, wheat fortification, and promoting private sector entrepreneurship. USAID TAWON will address the lack of dietary diversity and poor nutrition by focusing on five (5) nutrition sensitive agriculture sectors. These five sectors will include Agriculture Extension, Vegetables, Fruits, Dairy, and Irrigation Water. This combination of activities will increase agricultural production which will directly address lack of Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, and animal protein in the diet. Agriculture production activities must be linked and coordinated with on-going USAID nutrition activities to assure target beneficiaries properly consume adequate amounts of agricultural products targeted by USAID TAWON. \u00a0 The solicitation is anticipated to be released by January 1, 2015 and will be made available electronically upon its release to www.fbo.gov.

    "This notebook is intended to facilitate a Dojo on a very simple Kata for beginners to Python and py.test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER**:\n",
    "This content introduces basic Python usage enough to solve the proposed kata, which might not be the most appropriate for many real world cases.\n",
    "Some of the code used here to solve the kata could be improved by adding more adequate tools and libraries, like, for example, data munching, which could be improved a lot by using libraries like `numpy`, or `pandas`. However, showing how to use these, which are not plain basic Python, is not the goal of this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this session is to show up TDD techniques, using pretty much standard and basic Python, explaining just what's required to solve the proposed Kata.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is driven with many steps, so the audience is expected to fit just what's required, not trying to get extra bonus.\n",
    "This is not a competition, not a contest, there is no price."

    "Some level of programming knowledge might be required.\n",
    "Since Python is pretty readable and clear, the code should be easy to understand."

Understanding sockets
=====================

A test driven session introducing the socket communication with Python.

After a brief talk on [Berkeley sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets), we will do some exercises with unix and 
internet socket using the Python interface module.

The goal of this session is to achieve solid knowledge about what is a socket 
and how to implement both client and server sides with Python.

Please, ensure you have any Python interpreter (preferably 3.5) and pytest 
installed in your preferred environment.
